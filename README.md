Welcome to the oyname Engine! This is a simple hobby project dedicated to creating a 3D engine. 
Please note that this engine has been developed purely out of hobby interest, and I make no claim to professional quality.

My goal is to explore the fundamentals of 3D programming and implement creative ideas. 
The oyname Engine is a place for experimentation and learning, without the pressure of meeting commercial standards.

I invite everyone interested to exchange ideas and learn together. At the oyname Engine, the joy of discovery is paramount.

Thank you for your interest in my project!
